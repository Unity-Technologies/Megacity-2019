![Main Menu](Readme/main-menu.gif)

## Add Unity Gaming Services (UGS)

Megacity Multiplayer uses several services from UGS to facilitate connectivity between players. To use these services inside your project, you need a [Unity Account](https://docs.unity.com/ugs-overview/en/manual/creating-unity-ids) and [create an organization](https://support.unity.com/hc/en-us/articles/208592876-How-do-I-create-a-new-Organization-) within the Unity Dashboard.

You can still use Megacity Multiplayer without UGS, but for a better multiplayer experience, it is recommended to use the following services:

### Game Server Hosting (Multiplay)

**Game Server Hosting**, formerly known as Multiplay, is a robust and flexible infrastructure for hosting multiplayer games. It ensures a smooth operation of your game by delivering proven performance and scalability. With Game Server Hosting, you can launch your multiplayer titles with confidence, knowing that you have the support of a reliable global platform. The enables you to spend less time troubleshooting and more time building your game with the help of comprehensive documentation, samples, and software development kits (SDKs) designed for interoperability. To get started with Game Server Hosting, refer to the official [documentation](https://docs.unity.com/game-server-hosting/en/manual/guides/get-started).

**Warning**: Game Server Hosting is a pay-as-you-go service with a free tier. You must sign up for UGS services with a credit card to start using Game Server Hosting. If you exceed the [free tier usage allowance](https://unity.com/solutions/gaming-services/pricing), you will be charged. See our [Billing FAQ](https://support.unity.com/hc/en-us/articles/6821475035412-Billing-FAQ) to learn more.

To use Game Server Hosting in your project, you need to [Integrate the Game Server Hosting](https://docs.unity.com/game-server-hosting/manual/guides/get-started#Integrat) service from the [Unity Dashboard](https://dashboard.unity3d.com/multiplay).

**Note**: You must be an Owner or Manager of your organization to enable Game Server Hosting.

After you integrate Game Server Hosting, you must create a [build](https://docs.unity.com/game-server-hosting/manual/guides/get-started#Create), a [build configuration](https://docs.unity.com/game-server-hosting/manual/guides/get-started#Create2), a [fleet](https://docs.unity.com/game-server-hosting/manual/guides/get-started#Create3), and a [test allocation](https://docs.unity.com/game-server-hosting/manual/guides/get-started#Create4).

**Tip**: Check out our YouTube video [How to set up Game Server Hosting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oN2c9teXi7M).

For Megacity Multiplayer, we use the following Game Server Hosting configuration:

- **Launch parameters**: `-ip $$ip$$ -port $$port$$ -queryport $$query_port$$ -logFile $$log_dir$$/$$timestamp$$-Engine.log`
- **CPU Speed**: 1500 MHz
- **Memory**: 1600 MB

### Matchmaker

**Matchmaker** is a versatile tool that enables you to customize matches in your game. It offers fast and efficient matches, multi-region orchestration, and backfill options. With its flexible configuration, dynamic scalability, and robust rule engine, Matchmaker simplifies matchmaking while supporting complex game loops. For more information, consult the [Matchmaker Quick Start Guide](https://docs.unity.com/matchmaker/en/manual/matchmaker-quick-start).

To use Matchmaker in your project, you must **Enable** and **Integrate** the Matchmaker service from the [Unity Dashboard](https://dashboard.unity3d.com/matchmaker).

For Megacity Multiplayer, we use the following Matchmaker configuration:

Creating the [queue](https://docs.unity.com/matchmaker/en/manual/advanced-topics-queues-pools#Queues):
- **Maximum players on a ticket**: 12

Creating a default [pool](https://docs.unity.com/matchmaker/en/manual/advanced-topics-queues-pools#Pools):
- **Timeout**: 60 seconds

For Matchmaker [rules](https://docs.unity.com/matchmaker/manual/matchmaking-rules-rules), we use the following configuration:
- **Backfill enabled**: true 
- **Team count min**: 1
- **Team count max**: 1
- **Player count min**: 64
- **Player count max**: 256
- **Relaxation 1**: Replace min, Replacement value: 32, at seconds: 5
- **Relaxation 2**: Replace min, Replacement value: 1, at seconds: 10

After configuring the services on the dashboard website, navigate to **Edit > Project Settings > Service** and choose your organization and project ID.

![Project ID](Readme/setting-project-id.png)

Next, click on the play button to initiate the game. To access the Matchmaking services, navigate to the main menu and select **"Matchmake"** from the radio button menu, followed by clicking the **"Find Match"** button.

![Selecting Matchmaking](Readme/selecting-matchmaking.png)

Once the "Find Match" button is clicked, the Matchmaking services will initiate the connection process with the server. During this time, a circular loading indicator will be presented to signify that the system is in the process of establishing the connection. Once the connection is established, you will be able to start gameplay.

![Selecting Matchmaking](Readme/establishing-connection.gif)

### Vivox

**Vivox** is a voice chat service that enables players to communicate with each other in-game. To use [Vivox](https://unity.com/products/vivox), you need to connect your project to Vivox from the Unity Editor and enable Vivox in the [Unity Dashboard](https://dashboard.unity3d.com/vivox.).

For more information about Vivox, and how to use it you can read the [Vivox quickstart guide](https://docs.vivox.com/v5/general/unity/15_1_200000/en-us/Default.htm#Unity/vivox-unity-first-steps.htm).
  
## Test Your Multiplayer Setup

Megacity Multiplayer is server-authoritative, which means the server has ultimate authority and control over the game's state and rules. To test the game, a server needs to be running, and clients need to connect to the server. This can be done in the Editor, locally, or through Game Server Hosting (Multiplay).

---------------

### Connect
### Editor Local Multiplayer Setup (Without UGS)

For testing purposes, you can run the Client and Server in the Editor. This enables inspection of entities, systems, components, etc. while running on both the Server and Client.

To set up the Editor for local multiplayer:
1. Go to **Project Settings** > **Entities**. 
2. Set the **NetCode Client Target** to `ClientAndServer`.
3. Open Multiplayer PlayMode Tools from **Multiplayer** > **Window: PlayMode Tools**. 
4. Set the **PlayMode Type** to `Client & Server`.

In the **Assets > Settings > Gameplay > MultiplayerServerSettings**, you have the ability to configure a server list that will be presented in the play mode Main menu window. This functionality allows for the establishment of multiple connections and facilitates the use of the Default IP connection.

![Setting IP](Readme/setting-ip.png)

To begin, click the play button in the Unity Editor to launch the game. Once the game is running and you are in the Main Menu, navigate to the **Connect** option in the radio button menu. From the **drop-down box**, select the desired IP address to establish a connection. If the desired IP address is not available in the list, you have the option to create a new entry and re-enter play mode. Alternatively, you can manually enter your own IP address using the provided text field.

![Selecting Connect](Readme/selecting-connect.png)

By default, the project is configured to use the **Local** IP address. If you are testing the game in the Editor, selecting the Local IP option will allow you to run both the server and client within the Editor, enabling you to play the game.

Once you have selected the appropriate IP address, click the **Connect** button to initiate the connection process.

Now, when you play the game from the Editor, the Server and Client run together on your local machine. To inspect Client or Server entities, systems, etc., you can use the Entities window (**Window** > **Entities**). For example, if you open **Entities Hierarchy**, you can select the desired **World** to inspect from the dropdown. See the following image:

![Entities Hierarchy](Readme/entities-hierarchy.gif)

---------------

### Build Local Multiplayer Setup (Without UGS)

To build your game and test it locally, you need to build the Client and Server separately.

To make a Client Build:
1. In the Editor, go to **Project Settings** > **Entities** to change the **NetCode Client Target** to `Client`.
2. Like any other Unity game, make the build by going to **File** > **Build Settings**.
3. Enable the `Megacity` scene and set the target platform is `Windows, Mac, Linux`.
4. Press the **Build** button.

![Build Settings - Client](Readme/build-settings-client.jpg)

To make a Server Build:
1. Set the target platform to **Dedicated Server**.
2. Like the Client build, go to **File** > **Build Settings** and press the **Build** button.
